/**
 * 
 * Typescript syntax examples some things.
 * 
 * You can try like making the code wrong or something and see that typescript is angry when you are wrong.
 * In contrast to javascript who don't care about you at all, even when wrong ðŸ˜­
 * 
 * If anything here seems interesting you should probably look it up elsewhere also to get a good understanding.
 * 
 * Some things to note:
 * Typescript needs to be compiled/transpiled into javascript in order to run in the browser.
 * There are several compilers, examples are babel and the official typescript "tsc" compiler
 * Most js bundlers do it for you nowadays
